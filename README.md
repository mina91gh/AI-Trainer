# AI-Trainer
A demo application built with MediaPipe’s pose and hand-tracking pipelines to detect thumbs-up gestures and count arm-curl repetitions. The model analyzes elbow and wrist landmark positions, determines curl phases, and increments a rep counter when a full curl extension–contraction cycle is detected.
